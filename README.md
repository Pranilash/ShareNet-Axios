## How It's Made

### Android SDK

The app is developed using Kotlin and leverages Android’s modern libraries to ensure a robust and efficient user experience. It uses Android’s ViewModel and LiveData for managing UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way.

### Firebase Integration

Firebase is utilized for authentication and real-time data management. It handles user sign-in, sign-up, and session management, as well as storing and syncing data across devices.

### UI Components

The user interface is designed using RecyclerView for displaying lists of items and ConstraintLayout for flexible UI layouts. Data Binding is used to bind UI components with data sources, simplifying UI updates.

### Data Binding

The app uses Android’s Data Binding Library to bind UI components directly to data sources.
